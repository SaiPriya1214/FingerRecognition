# FingerRecognition
Developed a computer vision application that accurately counts the number of fingers shown to a webcam in real-time. Leveraging the power of Mediapipe and Pygame libraries, the application utilizes advanced image processing techniques to detect and track the user's hand landmarks and precisely count the extended fingers. By implementing robust algorithms and utilizing machine learning models, the system achieves high accuracy and reliability in finger counting, making it suitable for a variety of applications such as gesture-based control systems, sign language recognition, and interactive user interfaces. The project showcases expertise in computer vision, feature extraction, and real-time object tracking, demonstrating a strong ability to apply cutting-edge technologies to practical applications.
